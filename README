some utility scripts

# svnchanges
Sometimes, you would need to find out since when a certain function or API has been committed, and then determine the Jira ID of that commit. 'svnchanges' can show the differences for each commit over a period of time.

# gitchanges
"Usage:"
"gitchanges [commit or number changes] filename"
"It shows changes since @commit, not including, or last @number of changes."
"The max number of changes to show is fixed as 100."
"By default, it would show last 5 changes."

# gitallst
List the status of all local git branches.

# vimm
In the 'grep' result, the format is typically filename.c:line_number ... when we would like to edit filename.c and quickly go to the line 'line_number', the command would be 'vim filename.c +line_number'. 'vimm filename.c:line_number' can do the same thing, while getting more handy by pasting the a line of grep search result.
